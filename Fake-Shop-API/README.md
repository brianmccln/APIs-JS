#### Fake Shop API
This is a excellent, fun API invented by an excellent programmer named 
Mohammad Reza Keikavousi. With this API, you can mock up a shopping site without having to have any actual data or a database.
- Here is the link to the project on **GitHub: **https://github.com/keikaavousi**
- And here is a link to the **API website: https://fakestoreapi.com/**
I did my example following the steps provided with the API documentation.
I did mine in JavaScript, but as the API returns JSON, you can use it with a variety of different programming languages.
